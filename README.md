## Hi there, my name is...
...tricky to pronounce â€“ it's Przemek (P-sh-ee-meck).  
For an easier reference, you can check out how [Google Translate pronounces it](https://translate.google.com/?sl=pl&tl=en&text=przemek&op=translate).  
Interestingly, it translates my name to "slog", which apparently means "to work hard over a long period of time".

Well, that's exactly what I've been doing â€“ and plan to keep doing.

My transition into cloud communication ignited a passion for cloud technologies, and it's where I'm focused now as I grow my expertise in this field.

Cheers.
