## Hi there, my name is...
...tricky to pronounce â€“ it's Przemek (P-sh-ee-meck). 
For an easier reference, you can check out [Google Translate's take](https://translate.google.com/?sl=pl&tl=en&text=przemek&op=translate).
Interestingly, it translates my name to "a slog," which means to work hard over a long period.

Well, that's exactly what I've been doing â€“ and plan to keep doing.

My transition into cloud communication ignited a passion for cloud technologies, and it's where I'm focused now as I grow my expertise in this field.

Cheers.
